Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 5.0.2 and 4.9.6.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-48930","commit_shas":"8bd6446e000fa59df3cda0ae3e424300747ea5ed; 9a15fff274f83a6ec7f675f1121babcc0c42292f; e256905ee649a7caacc251f7c964667195a52221","publish_date":"2024-10-21","severity":"UNKNOWN:11","summary":"secp256k1-node is a Node.js binding for an Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.

In ssh2 before version 1.4.0 there is a command injection vulnerability. The issue only exists on Windows. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

HIGH:1","summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 5.0.2 and 4.9.6.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-48930","commit_shas":"8bd6446e000fa59df3cda0ae3e424300747ea5ed; 9a15fff274f83a6ec7f675f1121babcc0c42292f; e256905ee649a7caacc251f7c964667195a52221","publish_date":"2024-10-21","severity":"UNKNOWN:11","summary":"secp256k1-node is a Node.js binding for an Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.

In ssh2 before version 1.4.0 there is a command injection vulnerability. The issue only exists on Windows. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.

HIGH:1","summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 5.0.2 and 4.9.6.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC165Checker.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC721.behavior_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Governor.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/MerkleProof.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/ERC2771Context.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/openzeppelin-openzeppelin-contracts/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OpenZeppelin_openzeppelin-contracts/Base64.test_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-48930","commit_shas":"8bd6446e000fa59df3cda0ae3e424300747ea5ed; 9a15fff274f83a6ec7f675f1121babcc0c42292f; e256905ee649a7caacc251f7c964667195a52221","publish_date":"2024-10-21","severity":"UNKNOWN:11","summary":"secp256k1-node is a Node.js binding for an Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.

In ssh2 before version 1.4.0 there is a command injection vulnerability. The issue only exists on Windows. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

HIGH:1","summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer.

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.

HIGH:1","summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer.

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.

HIGH:1","summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization. ||  OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves. || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n || OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer.

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This is fixed in version 1.4.0. || The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.
