Starting with version 2.9.0.beta5 and prior to version 2.9.0.beta10, an incomplete quote can generate a JavaScript error which will crash the current page in the browser in some cases.

Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the \"require moderator approval of all new topics\" setting set.

Versions prior to 3.1.0.beta1 (beta) (tests-passed) are vulnerable to  Allocation of Resources Without Limits. Users can create chat drafts of an unlimited length, which can cause a denial of service by generating an excessive load on the server. Additionally, an unlimited number of drafts were loaded when loading the user. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.0.beta1 (beta) and (tests-passed). Users should upgrade to the latest version where a limit has been introduced. There are no workarounds available. || Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when submitting a membership request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280 characters has been introduced for membership requests. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion.

There are no known workarounds. || Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to 3.2.5 and 3.3.0.beta5, crafting requests to submit very long tag group names can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.5 and 3.3.0.beta5. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs wasn't enforcing limits on the number of URLs that it accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict denial of service on some parts of the app. This vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated users. This issue has been patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should turn off the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting and remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting. || Discourse is an open-source community platform.

In affected versions default file permissions for log files created by the file, fileSync and dateFile appenders are world-readable (in unix). This could cause problems if log files contain sensitive information. This would affect any users that have not supplied their own permissions for the files via the mode parameter in the config. Users are advised to update.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileWriteStream_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileWriteStream_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/moveAndMaybeCompressFile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/moveAndMaybeCompressFile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/DateRollingFileStream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/DateRollingFileStream-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileStream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileStream-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/log4js-node-streamroller/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileWriteStream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/log4js-node_streamroller/RollingFileWriteStream-test_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"nextcloud/spreed","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"fullstack","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-24890","commit_shas":"b5112441b3f69228a1726df2008fd496dfc94152; 87de72925ef93ee6595c7c5092392d623cc8aecf; 8c7461590e726f927e9266ef794f4e5d2c55f3a0","publish_date":"2022-05-17","severity":"LOW:9","summary":"Nextcloud Talk is a video and audio conferencing app for Nextcloud.

Prior to version 0.16.6, Wasp authentication has a vulnerability in the OAuth authentication implementation (affecting only Keycloak with a specific config). Wasp currently lowercases OAuth user IDs before storing / fetching them. This behavior violates OAuth and OpenID Connect specifications and can result in user impersonation, account collisions, and privilege escalation. In practice, out of the OAuth providers that Wasp auth supports, only Keycloak is affected. Keycloak uses a lowercase UUID by default, but users can configure it to be case sensitive, making it affected. Google, GitHub, and Discord use numerical IDs, making them not affected. Users should update their Wasp version to `0.16.6` which has a fix for the problematic behavior. Users using Keycloak can work around the issue by not using a case sensitive user ID in their realm configuration.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wasp-lang-wasp/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wasp-lang-wasp/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wasp-lang_wasp/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wasp-lang_wasp/utils_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wasp-lang-wasp/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wasp-lang-wasp/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wasp-lang_wasp/utils.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wasp-lang_wasp/utils.d_fixed.js"}]}]
