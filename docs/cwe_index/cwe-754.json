In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/App_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/App_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/system_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/system_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/paths_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/paths_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mintplex-labs-anything-llm/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Mintplex-Labs_anything-llm/package_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"NodeBB/NodeBB","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2015-9286; CVE-2020-15149; CVE-2021-43786; CVE-2021-43787; CVE-2021-43788; CVE-2022-36045; CVE-2022-36076; CVE-2022-3978; CVE-2022-46164; CVE-2023-26045; CVE-2023-2850; CVE-2023-30591; CVE-2024-57041","commit_shas":"e24bd2c0e33f642e8fdbc0d6b6a52dc6624d0d9a; c2477d9d5ffc43e5ffeb537ea2ceb4ce9592aa39; 04dab1d550cdebf4c1567bca9a51f8b9ca48a500; 1783f918bc19568f421473824461ff2ed7755e4c; c8b2fc46dc698db687379106b3f01c71b80f495f; e802fab87f94a13f397f04cfe6068f2f7ddf7888; 81e3c1ba488d03371a5ce8d0ebb5c5803026e0f9; a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4; 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38; 48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8; ec58700f6dff8e5b4af1544f6205ec362b593092; 51096ad2345fb1d1380bec0a447113489ef6c359; 4d2d76897a02e7068ab74c81d17a2febfae8bfb9; 37b48b82a4bc7680c6e4c42647209010cb239c2c; 830f142b7aea2e597294a84d52c05aab3a3539ca; 4e69bff72fd04779064d37e46a43080e6c328adf","publish_date":"2025-01-24","severity":"CRITICAL:15; MEDIUM:14; HIGH:6","summary":"Controllers.outgoing in controllers/index.js in NodeBB before 0.7.3 has outgoing XSS. || NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server. This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions incorrect logic present in the token verification step unintentionally allowed master token access to the API. The vulnerability has been patch as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their profile.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/user_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/user_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_12_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_12_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspac

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version.

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/image-editor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/settings_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"d

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability.

The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/directus_directus/image-editor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augment

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/fastify_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/fastify_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/handleRequest_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/handleRequest_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/contentTypeParser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/contentTypeParser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/content-parser.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/content-parser.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/fastify-fastify/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/custom-parser.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/fastify_fastify/custom-parser.test_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"feathersjs/feathers","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-37899","commit_shas":"9fcaf37864d6839760cd6ca957f6a9f434841da4; ff0f270ed9a4e74b3fa49a095a077d6b0bbf0d2b","publish_date":"2023-07-19","severity":"HIGH:2","summary":"Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic

In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet.

This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions incorrect logic present in the token verification step unintentionally allowed master token access to the API. The vulnerability has been patch as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version.

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/directus_directus/i

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic

In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised to upgrade.

This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions incorrect logic present in the token verification step unintentionally allowed master token access to the API. The vulnerability has been patch as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version.

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/image-editor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/directus_directus/settings_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"d

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability.

In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their

A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/app_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/app_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/assets_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/assets_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/env_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/env_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/files_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/files_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/index.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/index.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/webhooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/webhooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/logger_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/logger_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/v-form_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/v-form_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/directus-directus/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/directus_directus/image-editor_vulnerable.js","original

9.4.1 are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via SVG file upload in media upload functionality. A low privileged attacker can inject arbitrary javascript code which will be executed in a victim’s browser when they open the image URL. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface. || In directus versions v9.0.0-beta.2 through 9.6.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the media upload functionality which allows a low privileged user to perform internal network port scans. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.  || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.23.3, the `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. This issue is patched in version 9.23.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.12.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a \"helpful\" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. || Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the

a request with \"Content-Type: application/json\" and a very large payload. || fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers. || Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type’s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hd
