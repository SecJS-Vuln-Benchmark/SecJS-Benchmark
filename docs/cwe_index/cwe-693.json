The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188; CVE-2024-33883","commit_shas":"49264e0037e313a0a3e033450b5c184112516d8f; e469741dca7df2eb400199e1cdb74621e3f89aa5","publish_date":"2024-04-28","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"nodejs ejs version older than 2.5.5 is vulnerable to a Cross-site-scripting in the ejs.renderFile() resulting in code injection || The ejs (aka Embedded JavaScript templates) package before 3.1.10 for Node.js lacks certain pollution protection.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/ejs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/ejs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/utils_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"misskey-dev/summaly","dataset":"final","project_type":"frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2025-46553","commit_shas":"45153b4f08a772c395a13f7a25399dd87ed022ed","publish_date":"2025-05-05","severity":"UNKNOWN:3","summary":"@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page.

The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188;

The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188;

There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/web-contents_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/web-contents_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/server_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/server_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/electron_electron/init_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"ethyca/fides","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-41319; CVE-2024-38537; CVE-2024-31223","commit_shas":"5989b5fa744c8d8c340963b895a054883549358a; 868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005; 0555080541f18a5aacff452c590ac9a1b56d7097","publish_date":"2024-07-03","severity":"MEDIUM:7; HIGH:1; NONE:1","summary":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188;

The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"original","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188; CVE-2024-33883","commit_shas":"49264e0037e313a0a3e033450b5c184112516d8f; e469741dca7df2eb400199e1cdb74621e3f89aa5","publish_date":"2024-04-28","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"nodejs ejs version older than 2.5.5 is vulnerable to a Cross-site-scripting in the ejs.renderFile() resulting in code injection || The ejs (aka Embedded JavaScript templates) package before 3.1.10 for Node.js lacks certain pollution protection.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/ejs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/ejs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/mde-ejs/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/mde_ejs/utils_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"misskey-dev/summaly","dataset":"original","project_type":"frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2025-46553","commit_shas":"45153b4f08a772c395a13f7a25399dd87ed022ed","publish_date":"2025-05-05","severity":"UNKNOWN:3","summary":"@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page.

There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/web-contents_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/web-contents_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/server_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/server_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/electron_electron/init_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"ethyca/fides","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-41319; CVE-2024-38537; CVE-2024-31223","commit_shas":"5989b5fa744c8d8c340963b895a054883549358a; 868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005; 0555080541f18a5aacff452c590ac9a1b56d7097","publish_date":"2024-07-03","severity":"MEDIUM:7; HIGH:1; NONE:1","summary":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. || Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/ConnectorTemplateUploadModal_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides-js_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides-js_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides-tcf_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/fides_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/consent-types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/consent-types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/server-environment_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/server-environment_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/ethyca-fides/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/ethyca_fides/getPropertyFromUrl_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"mde/ejs","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2017-1000188;
