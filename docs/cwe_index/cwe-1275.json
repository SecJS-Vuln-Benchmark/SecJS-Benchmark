In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/create_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/misskey-dev_misskey/create_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_file

In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/misskey-dev_misskey/create_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_works

In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/dialog_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/download-url_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/send-drive-file_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/proxy-media_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/UrlPreviewService_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/MkUrlPreview_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/MkYoutubePlayer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/misskey-dev_misskey/abuse-user-reports_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/misskey-dev-misskey/

In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`.

In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`.

In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.\n || Nexkey is a lightweight fork of Misskey v12 optimized for small to medium size servers. Prior to 12.23Q4.5, Nexkey allows external apps using tokens issued by administrators and moderators to call admin APIs.  This allows malicious third-party apps to perform operations such as updating server settings, as well as compromise object storage and email server credentials. This issue has been patched in 12.23Q4.5. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF). || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`.
