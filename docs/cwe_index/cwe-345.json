Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server.

Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute.

If your app uses remote, calls webContents.sendToFrame, or calls event.reply in an IPC message handler then it is impacted by this issue.

In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0. || Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature. || matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality.

Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server.

The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute.

In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0. || Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature. || matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality.

Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/StatementLog_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/StatementLog_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/SearchResultItem_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/SearchResultItem_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/sql-autocompleter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/pinterest_querybook/sql-autocompleter_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"sidekiq/sidekiq","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-26141","commit_shas":"62c90d7c5a7d8a378d79909859d87c2e0702bf89","publish_date":"2023-09-14","severity":"HIGH:2","summary":"Versions of the package sidekiq before 7.1.3 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient checks in the dashboard-charts.js file.

In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0. || Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature. || matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality.

Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server.

Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user.

The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute.

If your app uses remote, calls webContents.sendToFrame, or calls event.reply in an IPC message handler then it is impacted by this issue.

In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0. || Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature. || matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality.

Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

In matrix-react-sdk before version 3.15.0, the user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk. This has been fixed in version 3.15.0. || Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection. || matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature. || matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality.

provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to 5.0.6, the fast-jwt library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim structured as ['https://attacker-domain/', 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation, the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore, if the application relies on external libraries like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially, the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array, alongside the legitimate issuer, and bypass the intended security checks.

Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2. || Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/StatementLog_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/StatementLog_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/SearchResultItem_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/SearchResultItem_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pinterest-querybook/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/sql-autocompleter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/pinterest_querybook/sql-autocompleter_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"sidekiq/sidekiq","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-26141","commit_shas":"62c90d7c5a7d8a378d79909859d87c2e0702bf89","publish_date":"2023-09-14","severity":"HIGH:2","summary":"Versions of the package sidekiq before 7.1.3 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient checks in the dashboard-charts.js file.
