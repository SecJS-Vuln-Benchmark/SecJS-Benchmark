Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.min_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.min_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.services_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.services_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/amauric-tarteaucitron-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.services.min_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/AmauriC_tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.services.min_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2025-1467; CVE-2025-31138; CVE-2025-31475; CVE-2025-31476; CVE-2025-48939","commit_shas":"12490579001d5caa187adcaecb01da570a12076b; 25fcf828aaa55306ddc09cfbac9a6f8f126e2d07; 74c354c413ee3f82dff97a15a0a43942887c2b5b; 2fa1e01023bce2e4b813200600bb1619d56ceb02; 230a3b69d363837acfa895823d841e0608826ba3","publish_date":"2025-07-03","severity":"MEDIUM:12","summary":"Versions of the package tarteaucitronjs before 1.17.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the getElemWidth() and getElemHeight().

A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (width and height) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like 100%;height:100%;position:fixed;, potentially covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate content, trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking), or disrupt the intended functionality and accessibility of the website. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1. || tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where the addOrUpdate function, used for applying custom texts, did not properly validate input. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution. An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to modify object prototypes, affecting core JavaScript behavior, cause application crashes or unexpected behavior, or potentially introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1. || tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert(). Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior.
