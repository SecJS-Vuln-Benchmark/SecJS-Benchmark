This issue is specific to macOS as these fuses are only currently supported on macOS. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `.app` bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/api-browser-window-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/web-contents_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/web-contents_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/server_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/server_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/api-ipc-main-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/guest-window-manager-spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/internal-ambient.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/internal-electron.d_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/fs-wrapper_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/electron-electron/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/electron_electron/init_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"hap-wi/roxy-wi","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-25802","commit_shas":"0054f25da7cf8c7480452f48e39308b5e392dc67","publish_date":"2023-03-13","severity":"HIGH:8","summary":"Roxy-WI is a Web interface for managing Haproxy, Nginx, Apache, and Keepalived servers.

The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute.

The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute. This will prevent them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway. || The Electron framework lets users write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions of Electron IPC prior to 9.4.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 12.0.0-beta.9, messages sent from the main process to a subframe in the renderer process, through webContents.sendToFrame, event.reply or when using the remote module, can in some cases be delivered to the wrong frame. If your app uses remote, calls webContents.sendToFrame, or calls event.reply in an IPC message handler then it is impacted by this issue. This has been fixed in versions 9.4.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 12.0.0-beta.9.

This has been patched and Electron versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6` contain the fix.
