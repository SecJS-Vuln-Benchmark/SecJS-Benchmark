[{"project":"github/codeql-action","dataset":"final","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2021-32638; CVE-2025-24362","commit_shas":"58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb; 88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db; 29620a04997e62b4c9fee0b18f507aa3e1288345; 519de26711ecad48bde264c51e414658a82ef3fa","publish_date":"2025-01-24","severity":"MEDIUM:11; UNKNOWN:3","summary":"Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs. || In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.\n\nFor some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.\n\nEnvironment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:\n- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.\n- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.\n- Running with debug artifacts enabled.\n- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.\n- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.\n- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.\n\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:\n- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.\n- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).\n\nIn rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.\n\nIn CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. \n\nOn Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.\nThe intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.\n\nTherefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.\n\nThe impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:\n- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.\n- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/runner_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/runner_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/api-client_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/api-client_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/util_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/util_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/util.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/util.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/debug-artifacts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/github_codeql-action/debug-artifacts_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"github/codeql-action","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2021-32638; CVE-2025-24362","commit_shas":"58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb; 88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db; 29620a04997e62b4c9fee0b18f507aa3e1288345; 519de26711ecad48bde264c51e414658a82ef3fa","publish_date":"2025-01-24","severity":"MEDIUM:11; UNKNOWN:3","summary":"Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository.

Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs. || In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.\n\nFor some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.\n\nEnvironment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:\n- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.\n- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.\n- Running with debug artifacts enabled.\n- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.\n- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.\n- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.\n\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:\n- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.\n- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).\n\nIn rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.\n\nIn CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. \n\nOn Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.\nThe intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.\n\nTherefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.\n\nThe impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:\n- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.\n- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/runner_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/runner_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/api-client_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/api-client_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/util_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/util_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/util.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/util.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/github-codeql-action/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/debug-artifacts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/github_codeql-action/debug-artifacts_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"github/codeql-action","dataset":"original","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2021-32638; CVE-2025-24362","commit_shas":"58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb; 88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db; 29620a04997e62b4c9fee0b18f507aa3e1288345; 519de26711ecad48bde264c51e414658a82ef3fa","publish_date":"2025-01-24","severity":"MEDIUM:11; UNKNOWN:3","summary":"Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository.
