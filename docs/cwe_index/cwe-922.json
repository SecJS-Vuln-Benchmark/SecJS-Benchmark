The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text.

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"v

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augment

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text.

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious
