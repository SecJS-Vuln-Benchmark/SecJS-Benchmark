In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data.

In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/drpaulbrewer-cumulative-distribution-function/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/drpaulbrewer-cumulative-distribution-function/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/DrPaulBrewer_cumulative-distribution-function/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/DrPaulBrewer_cumulative-distribution-function/index_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"InternalError503/forget-it","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2015-10103","commit_shas":"adf0c7fd59b9c935b4fd675c556265620124999c","publish_date":"2023-04-17","severity":"LOW:4","summary":"A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in InternalError503 Forget It up to 1.3.

At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal to the fedify server's network. This applies to not just resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also to media URLs as well. Specifically this is a Server Side Request Forgery attack. Users should upgrade to Fedify version 0.9.2, 0.10.1, or 0.11.1 to receive a patch for this issue. || Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards. This vulnerability allows a user to maneuver the Webfinger mechanism to perform a GET request to any internal resource on any Host, Port, URL combination regardless of present security mechanisms, and forcing the victim’s server into an infinite loop causing Denial of Service. Moreover, this issue can also be maneuvered into performing a Blind SSRF attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.14, 1.1.11, 1.2.11, and 1.3.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/docloader.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/docloader.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/docloader_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/docloader_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/lookup.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/lookup.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/dahlia-fedify/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/lookup_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/dahlia_fedify/lookup_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jpeg-js/jpeg-js","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-25851","commit_shas":"9ccd35fb5f55a6c4f1902ac5b0f270f675750c27; 04cb2dc95320f1afbd9d7c4b3ad095b23e3e264f","publish_date":"2022-06-10","severity":"HIGH:6","summary":"The package jpeg-js before 0.4.4 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) where a particular piece of input will cause to enter an infinite loop and never return.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/jpeg-js-jpeg-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/jpeg-js-jpeg-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/jpeg-js_jpeg-js/decoder_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/jpeg-js_jpeg-js/decoder_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/jpeg-js-jpeg-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/jpeg-js-jpeg-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/jpeg-js_jpeg-js/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/jpeg-js_jpeg-js/index_fixed.js"}]}]
