platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

available.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/cli_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/cli_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/constants_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/constants_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/events_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/events_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/dashboard-event-stream_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/dashboard-event-stream_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/server_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/server_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/actions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/actions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/api_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/api_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/menu_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/menu_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/hooks_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/hooks_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/garden-io-garden/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/garden-io_garden/run-results_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/f

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-28179","commit_shas":"bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03","publish_date":"2024-03-20","severity":"CRITICAL:1","summary":"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {\"sessionId\":{\"not\":\"a\"}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table.

platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-28179","commit_shas":"bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03","publish_date":"2024-03-20","severity":"CRITICAL:1","summary":"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_noise_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_noise_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"v

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {\"sessionId\":{\"not\":\"a\"}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table.

platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-28179","commit_shas":"bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03","publish_date":"2024-03-20","severity":"CRITICAL:1","summary":"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_noise_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause.

platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-28179","commit_shas":"bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03","publish_date":"2024-03-20","severity":"CRITICAL:1","summary":"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_obfuscated_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_obfuscated_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augment

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause.

platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/lunary-ai_lunary/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchma

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {\"sessionId\":{\"not\":\"a\"}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table.

platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines. || Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2024-28179","commit_shas":"bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03","publish_date":"2024-03-20","severity":"CRITICAL:1","summary":"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":

Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. || matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to.

Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance. || Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.\n\nThe risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute || As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level. || A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity. || Enable exports of the database and associated exported information of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been granted access to the system prior to the attack.\n\nIt is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once downloaded - deletes the export from the system.\n\nThe endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level. || Any user can delete an arbitrary folder (recursively) on a remote server due to bad input sanitization leading to path traversal. The attacker would need access to the server at some privilege level since this endpoint is protected and requires authorization. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the logo filename functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the logo filename to reference files outside of the restricted directory. This can lead to unauthorized reading or deletion of files by utilizing the `/api/system/upload-logo` and `/api/system/logo` endpoints. The issue stems from the lack of filtering or validation on the logo filename, allowing attackers to target sensitive files such as the application's database. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an improper input validation vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by deactivating 'Multi-User Mode'. By sending a specially crafted curl request with the 'multi_user_mode' parameter set to false, an attacker can deactivate 'Multi-User Mode'. This action permits the creation of a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized administrative access. || A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository when the application is running in 'just me' mode with a password. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a request to the endpoint using the [validatedRequest] middleware with a specially crafted 'Authorization:' header. This vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a DoS condition. || A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the filesystem, including critical database files such as 'anythingllm.db'. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and availability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software, with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker, with manager or admin privileges, can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts. || An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names. || A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the service, potentially leading to a denial of service.  || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0. || A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application, specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security. || A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link. || A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request. || A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application. || A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for the application's operation. || An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.  || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version latest contains a vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a password, is improperly stored within a JWT (JSON Web Token) used as a bearer token in single user mode. When decoded, the JWT reveals the password in plaintext. This improper storage of sensitive information poses significant security risks, as an attacker who gains access to the JWT can easily decode it and retrieve the password. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.3. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. || A vulnerability in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, as of commit 5c40419, allows low privilege users to access the sensitive API endpoint \"/api/system/custom-models\". This access enables them to modify the model's API key and base path, leading to potential API key leakage and denial of service on chats. || A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential data loss. || A vulnerability in AnythingLLM Docker version 1.3.1 allows users with 'Default' permission to access other users' profile pictures by changing the 'id' parameter in the user cookie. This issue is present in versions prior to 1.3.1. || In version 1.5.5 of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, the `/setup-complete` API endpoint allows unauthorized users to access sensitive system settings. The data returned by the `currentSettings` function includes sensitive information such as API keys for search engines, which can be exploited by attackers to steal these keys and cause loss of user assets. || A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager. || In mintplex-labs/anything-llm v1.5.11 desktop version for Windows, the application opens server port 3001 on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication by default. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full backend access, enabling them to perform actions such as deleting all data from the workspace. || mintplex-labs/anything-llm version git 6dc3642 contains an unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the API for the embeddable chat functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed JSON payload to the API endpoint, causing a server crash due to an uncaught exception. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.2. || A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint \"/embed/:embedId/stream-chat\" where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {\"sessionId\":{\"not\":\"a\"}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table.
