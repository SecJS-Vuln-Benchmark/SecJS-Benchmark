Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseUser.spec_vulnerab

1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to change the password of other admin accounts, including their own, without having to repeat their password. An attacker who managed to hijack an admin account might use this to lock out actual admins from their OctoPrint instance. The vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.0. || OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights into configuring a webcam snapshot URL which when tested through the \"Test\" button included in the web interface will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser when attempting to render the snapshot image. An attacker who successfully talked a victim with admin rights into performing a snapshot test with such a crafted URL could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.10.0rc3. OctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly vet who has admin access to their installation and what settings they modify based on instructions by strangers. || OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers.

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_fixed.js

Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"davedoesdev/python-jwt","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-39227","commit_shas":"88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9","publish_date":"2022-09-23","severity":"CRITICAL:5","summary":"python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key.

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_ben

Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"davedoesdev/python-jwt","dataset":"original","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-39227","commit_shas":"88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9","publish_date":"2022-09-23","severity":"CRITICAL:5","summary":"python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key.

OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1. Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/appkeys_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/pluginmanager_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/settings_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/access_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/loginstate_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/test-helpers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/octoprint-octoprint/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/OctoPrint_OctoPrint/classicwebcam_settings_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"davedoesdev/python-jwt","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-39227","commit_shas":"88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9","publish_date":"2022-09-23","severity":"CRITICAL:5","summary":"python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key.
