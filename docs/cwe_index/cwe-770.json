In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui <= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (<<) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0. || Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling loops that could hang the thread.

In versions prior to 2.7.8 rendering of d-popover tooltips can be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in the latest `stable` 2.7.8 version of Discourse. As a workaround users may ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In stable versions prior to 2.8.3 and beta versions prior 2.9.0.beta4 erroneously expose groups. When a group with restricted visibility has been used to set the permissions of a category, the name of the group is leaked to any user that is able to see the category. To workaround the problem, a site administrator can remove groups with restricted visibility from any category's permissions setting. || Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Starting with version 2.9.0.beta5 and prior to version 2.9.0.beta10, an incomplete quote can generate a JavaScript error which will crash the current page in the browser in some cases. Version 2.9.0.beta10 added a fix and tests to ensure incomplete quotes won't break the app. As a workaround, the quote can be fixed via the rails console. || Discourse is a platform for community discussion. Users who receive an invitation link that is not scoped to a single email address can enter any non-admin user's email and gain access to their account when accepting the invitation. All users should upgrade to the latest version. A workaround is temporarily disabling invitations with `SiteSetting.max_invites_per_day = 0` or scope them to individual email addresses. || In version 2.9.0.beta14 of Discourse, an open-source discussion platform, maliciously embedded urls can leak an admin's digest of recent topics, possibly exposing private information. A patch is available for version 2.9.0.beta15. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged users when a category has the \"require moderator approval of all new topics\" setting set. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16. || Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, tag descriptions, which can be updated by moderators, can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. Versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16 contain a patch. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Versions prior to 3.1.0.beta1 (beta) (tests-passed) are vulnerable to  Allocation of Resources Without Limits. Users can create chat drafts of an unlimited length, which can cause a denial of service by generating an excessive load on the server. Additionally, an unlimited number of drafts were loaded when loading the user. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.0.beta1 (beta) and (tests-passed). Users should upgrade to the latest version where a limit has been introduced. There are no workarounds available. || Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when submitting a membership request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280 characters has been introduced for membership requests. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, some links can inject arbitrary HTML tags when rendered through our Onebox engine. The issue is patched in version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds. || Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to 3.2.5 and 3.3.0.beta5, crafting requests to submit very long tag group names can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.5 and 3.3.0.beta5. || Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs wasn't enforcing limits on the number of URLs that it accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict denial of service on some parts of the app. This vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated users. This issue has been patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should turn off the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting and remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting. || Discourse is an open-source community platform. A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_11_fixe

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_v

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route. || By knowing an organization's ID, an attacker can join the organization without permission and gain the ability to read and modify all data within that organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information, posing a significant security risk. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of user permissions when joining an organization. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions. || lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token. Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks, by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId' endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different organizational projects. || An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, the DELETE endpoint located at `packages/backend/src/api/v1/datasets` is vulnerable to unauthorized dataset deletion due to missing authorization and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability allows any user, even those without a valid token, to delete a dataset by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. The issue was fixed in version 1.2.8. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it permits unauthorized users to delete datasets, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service. || An Improper Access Control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, where users can view and update any prompts in any projects due to insufficient access control checks in the handling of PATCH and GET requests for template versions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate or access sensitive project data, potentially leading to data integrity and confidentiality issues. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, version 1.2.10. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by maliciously manipulating regular expressions, which can significantly impact the response time of the application and potentially render it completely non-functional. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the application, leading to a denial of service where the application crashes. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified in lunary-ai/lunary, affecting versions up to and including 1.2.2. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, update, or delete any dataset_prompt or dataset_prompt_variation within any dataset or project. The issue stems from improper access control checks in the dataset management endpoints, where direct references to object IDs are not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.25. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls. || An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. || A broken access control vulnerability exists in the latest version of lunary-ai/lunary. The `saml.ts` file allows a user from one organization to update the Identity Provider (IDP) settings and view the SSO metadata of another organization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and potential account takeover if the email of a user in the target organization is known. || A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks. || An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run. || lunary-ai/lunary v1.2.26 contains an email injection vulnerability in the Send email verification API (/v1/users/send-verification) and Sign up API (/auth/signup). An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the application's brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage. || In version 1.3.2 of lunary-ai/lunary, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists. A user can view or delete external users by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the request URL. The application does not perform adequate checks on the 'id' parameter, allowing unauthorized access to external user data. || A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption. || In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated. || In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.7, there is a lack of rate limiting on the forgot password page, leading to an email bombing vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by automating forgot password requests to flood targeted user accounts with a high volume of password reset emails. This not only overwhelms the victim's mailbox, making it difficult to manage and locate legitimate emails, but also significantly impacts mail servers by consuming their resources. The increased load can cause performance degradation and, in severe cases, make the mail servers unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting email services for the entire organization. || lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to broken access control in the latest version. An attacker can view the content of any dataset without any kind of authorization by sending a GET request to the /v1/datasets endpoint without a valid authorization token. || In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations. || An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an improper access control vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user. This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input. || A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.25 contains an improper access control vulnerability in the POST /api/v1/data-warehouse/bigquery endpoint. This vulnerability allows any user to export the entire database data by creating a stream to Google BigQuery without proper authentication or authorization. The issue is fixed in version 1.4.26. || In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions. This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data. || In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.28, the /bigquery API route lacks proper access control, allowing any logged-in user to create a Datastream to Google BigQuery and export the entire database. This includes sensitive data such as password hashes and secret API keys. The route is protected by a config check (`config.DATA_WAREHOUSE_EXPORTS_ALLOWED`), but it does not verify the user's access level or implement any access control middleware. This vulnerability can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, disruption of services, credential compromise, and service integrity breaches. || A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.6.7 and earlier. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the SAML IdP XML metadata, which is used to generate the SAML login redirect URL. This URL is then set as the value of `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The issue is fixed in version 1.7.10. || lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/saml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/orgs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/users_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/emails_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/ml_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/CopyText_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/SocialProof_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Analytics_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Paywall_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/lunary-ai-lunary/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/lunary-ai_lunary/Sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_v
