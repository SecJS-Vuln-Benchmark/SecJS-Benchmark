The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their profile.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/user_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/NodeBB_NodeBB/user_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_12_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_12_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspac

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default as of wrangler@3.16.0, an  SSRF vulnerability in miniflare https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7  (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"goauthentik/authentik","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-36456; CVE-2023-46249; CVE-2023-48228; CVE-2024-42490; CVE-2024-47070; CVE-2024-52289; CVE-2024-52307; CVE-2025-52553; CVE-2025-53942","commit_shas":"15026748d19d490eb2baf9a9566ead4f805f7dff; c07a48a3eccbd7b23026f72136d3392bbc6f795a; ea75741ec22ecef34bc7073f1163e17a8a2bf9fc; 261879022d25016d58867cf1f24e90b81ad618d0; cdb36b420a8520cad2377733e070a8756290758f; 3af77ab3821fe9c7df8055ba5eade3d1ecea03a6; 8fe02b2aafb54aae12fb135d65eceeebc4dfc8e9; b88e39411c12e3f9e04125a7887f12354f760a14; 6b9afed21f7c39f171a4a445654cfe415bba37d5; 7a2110e455a00a66eac860df2a37151952ea8fe2; 359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11; 19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c; dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf; 78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29; 85bb638243c8d7ea42ddd3b15b3f51a90d2b8c54; 5ea4580884f99369f0ccfe484c04cb03a66e65b8; 0e07414e9739b318cff9401a413a5fe849545325; 7100d3c6741853f1cfe3ea2073ba01823ab55caa; 65373ab21711d58147b5cb9276c5b5876baaa5eb; c3629d12bfe3d32d3dc8f85c0ee1f087a55dde8f; 7a4c6b9b50f8b837133a7a1fd2cb9b7f18a145cd; ce3f9e3763c1778bf3a16b98c95d10f4091436ab","publish_date":"2025-07-23","severity":"HIGH:10; UNKNOWN:10; CRITICAL:4","summary":"authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/getServerSession.test_

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseUser.spec_vulnerab

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic. The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values.

Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort.

Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk.

outgoing XSS. || NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server. This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions incorrect logic present in the token verification step unintentionally allowed master token access to the API. The vulnerability has been patch as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin.

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2.

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore.

Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augment

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values. Therefore, if an empty session parameter is provided in the callback URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token contains an nonce value of \"\" (empty string), then adal.js will consider the JWT token as authentic.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"snyk/kubernetes-monitor","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-1065","commit_shas":"93be7784ad4048a7d4eda4537cb3cd4e58453d75; 5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157","publish_date":"2023-02-28","severity":"MEDIUM:19","summary":"This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues.

It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset.

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2.

As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hd

Server provide file storage for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Starting in version 26.0.0 and prior to version 26.0.2, an attacker could supply a URL that redirects an unsuspecting victim from a legitimate domain to an attacker's site. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform. In Nextcloud Server prior to versions 26.0.9 and 27.1.4; as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 23.0.12.13, 24.0.12.9, 25.0.13.4, 26.0.9, and 27.1.4; when an attacker manages to get access to an active session of another user via another way, they could delete and modify workflows by sending calls directly to the API bypassing the password confirmation shown in the UI.

No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. A malicious user was able to send delete requests for old versions of files they only got shared with read permissions.

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

HIGH:235; CRITICAL:54","summary":"In parser-server before version 4.1.0, you can fetch all the users objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

This was possible through the injection of a invalid HTML tag with a template injection payload on the next line. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.303.\n || Wiki.js is an open source wiki app built on Node.js. A disabled user can still gain access to a wiki by abusing the password reset function. While setting up SMTP e-mail's on my server, I tested said e-mails by performing a password reset with my test user. To my shock, not only did it let me reset my password, but after resetting my password I can get into the wiki I was locked out of. The ramifications of this bug is a user can **bypass an account disabling by requesting their password be reset**.  All users of wiki.js version `2.5.303` who use any account restrictions and have disabled user are affected. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.304 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/group_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/group_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/renderer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/renderer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/requarks_wiki/users_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"salvoravida/react-adal","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-7787","commit_shas":"716642464b0c891df64e414c45f1d1dad8f3fd4d","publish_date":"2020-12-09","severity":"HIGH:8","summary":"This affects all versions of package react-adal. It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic. The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values. Therefore, if an empty session parameter is provided in the callback URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token contains an nonce value of \"\" (empty string), then adal.js will consider the JWT token as authentic.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"snyk/kubernetes-monitor","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-1065","commit_shas":"93be7784ad4048a7d4eda4537cb3cd4e58453d75; 5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157","publish_date":"2023-02-28","severity":"MEDIUM:19","summary":"This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues.

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows certain user information to be extracted by attacker. || Denial-of-service in NodeBB <= v2.8.10 allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger a crash, when invoking `eventName.startsWith()` or `eventName.toString()`, while processing Socket.IO messages via crafted Socket.IO messages containing array or object type for the event name respectively. || A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NodeBB v3.11.0 allows remote attackers to store arbitrary code in the 'about me' section of their profile.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/profile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/authentication_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/uploads_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/languages_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/posts_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/translator_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils.common_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/utils_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/api_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/NodeBB_NodeBB/controllers_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nodebb-nodebb/sa

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2.

Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"goauthentik/authentik","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-36456; CVE-2023-46249; CVE-2023-48228; CVE-2024-42490; CVE-2024-47070; CVE-2024-52289; CVE-2024-52307; CVE-2025-52553; CVE-2025-53942","commit_shas":"15026748d19d490eb2baf9a9566ead4f805f7dff; c07a48a3eccbd7b23026f72136d3392bbc6f795a; ea75741ec22ecef34bc7073f1163e17a8a2bf9fc; 261879022d25016d58867cf1f24e90b81ad618d0; cdb36b420a8520cad2377733e070a8756290758f; 3af77ab3821fe9c7df8055ba5eade3d1ecea03a6; 8fe02b2aafb54aae12fb135d65eceeebc4dfc8e9; b88e39411c12e3f9e04125a7887f12354f760a14; 6b9afed21f7c39f171a4a445654cfe415bba37d5; 7a2110e455a00a66eac860df2a37151952ea8fe2; 359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11; 19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c; dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf; 78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29; 85bb638243c8d7ea42ddd3b15b3f51a90d2b8c54; 5ea4580884f99369f0ccfe484c04cb03a66e65b8; 0e07414e9739b318cff9401a413a5fe849545325; 7100d3c6741853f1cfe3ea2073ba01823ab55caa; 65373ab21711d58147b5cb9276c5b5876baaa5eb; c3629d12bfe3d32d3dc8f85c0ee1f087a55dde8f; 7a4c6b9b50f8b837133a7a1fd2cb9b7f18a145cd; ce3f9e3763c1778bf3a16b98c95d10f4091436ab","publish_date":"2025-07-23","severity":"HIGH:10; UNKNOWN:10; CRITICAL:4","summary":"authentik is an open-source Identity Provider.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_v

Server provide file storage for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Starting in version 26.0.0 and prior to version 26.0.2, an attacker could supply a URL that redirects an unsuspecting victim from a legitimate domain to an attacker's site. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform. In Nextcloud Server prior to versions 26.0.9 and 27.1.4; as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 23.0.12.13, 24.0.12.9, 25.0.13.4, 26.0.9, and 27.1.4; when an attacker manages to get access to an active session of another user via another way, they could delete and modify workflows by sending calls directly to the API bypassing the password confirmation shown in the UI. Nextcloud Server versions 26.0.9 and 27.1.4 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 23.0.12.13, 24.0.12.9, 25.0.13.4, 26.0.9, and 27.1.4 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. A malicious user was able to send delete requests for old versions of files they only got shared with read permissions.

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

requarks/wiki prior to 2.5.281. User can get root user permissions || Wiki.js is al wiki app built on Node.js. Client side template injection was discovered, that could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the content section of pages that would execute once a victim loads the page that contains the payload. This was possible through the injection of a invalid HTML tag with a template injection payload on the next line. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.303.\n || Wiki.js is an open source wiki app built on Node.js. A disabled user can still gain access to a wiki by abusing the password reset function. While setting up SMTP e-mail's on my server, I tested said e-mails by performing a password reset with my test user. To my shock, not only did it let me reset my password, but after resetting my password I can get into the wiki I was locked out of.

It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic. The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values. Therefore, if an empty session parameter is provided in the callback URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token contains an nonce value of \"\" (empty string), then adal.js will consider the JWT token as authentic.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"snyk/kubernetes-monitor","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-1065","commit_shas":"93be7784ad4048a7d4eda4537cb3cd4e58453d75; 5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157","publish_date":"2023-02-28","severity":"MEDIUM:19","summary":"This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues.

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default as of wrangler@3.16.0, an  SSRF vulnerability in miniflare https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7  (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2

Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"goauthentik/authentik","dataset":"original","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-36456; CVE-2023-46249; CVE-2023-48228; CVE-2024-42490; CVE-2024-47070; CVE-2024-52289; CVE-2024-52307; CVE-2025-52553; CVE-2025-53942","commit_shas":"15026748d19d490eb2baf9a9566ead4f805f7dff; c07a48a3eccbd7b23026f72136d3392bbc6f795a; ea75741ec22ecef34bc7073f1163e17a8a2bf9fc; 261879022d25016d58867cf1f24e90b81ad618d0; cdb36b420a8520cad2377733e070a8756290758f; 3af77ab3821fe9c7df8055ba5eade3d1ecea03a6; 8fe02b2aafb54aae12fb135d65eceeebc4dfc8e9; b88e39411c12e3f9e04125a7887f12354f760a14; 6b9afed21f7c39f171a4a445654cfe415bba37d5; 7a2110e455a00a66eac860df2a37151952ea8fe2; 359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11; 19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c; dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf; 78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29; 85bb638243c8d7ea42ddd3b15b3f51a90d2b8c54; 5ea4580884f99369f0ccfe484c04cb03a66e65b8; 0e07414e9739b318cff9401a413a5fe849545325; 7100d3c6741853f1cfe3ea2073ba01823ab55caa; 65373ab21711d58147b5cb9276c5b5876baaa5eb; c3629d12bfe3d32d3dc8f85c0ee1f087a55dde8f; 7a4c6b9b50f8b837133a7a1fd2cb9b7f18a145cd; ce3f9e3763c1778bf3a16b98c95d10f4091436ab","publish_date":"2025-07-23","severity":"HIGH:10; UNKNOWN:10; CRITICAL:4","summary":"authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/nextauthjs_next-auth/getServerSession.test_

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/PublicAPIRouter_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/middlewares_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQuery.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseLiveQueryServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/Definitions_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseServer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/LdapAuth.spec_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ldap_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/parse-community-parse-server/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/parse-community_parse-server/ParseUser.spec_vulnerab

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and

It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic. The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values.

Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort.

The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk.

outgoing XSS. || NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server. This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions incorrect logic present in the token verification step unintentionally allowed master token access to the API. The vulnerability has been patch as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. Prior to v1.18.5, a path traversal vulnerability was present that allowed users to access JSON files outside of the expected `languages/` directory. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability. || NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2. || A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in NodeBB up to 2.5.7. This affects an unknown part of the file /register/abort. The manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. Upgrading to version 2.5.8 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 2f9d8c350e54543f608d3d4c8e1a49bbb6cdea38. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213555. || NodeBB is an open source Node.js based forum software. Due to a plain object with a prototype being used in socket.io message handling a specially crafted payload can be used to impersonate other users and takeover accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may cherry-pick commit `48d143921753914da45926cca6370a92ed0c46b8` into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n || NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit. || NodeBB is affected by a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking vulnerability due to missing validation of the request origin.

An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81. || In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git. || In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results. || Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git). || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. || Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not trigger directly in a normal Wiki.js page. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) force download flag to all non-image file types, preventing the file from being viewed inline in the browser. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. --- Thanks to @Haxatron for reporting this vulnerability.

Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in Auth.js. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to 2.7.0, Audiobookshelf is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side request (SSRF) vulnerability in `podcastUtils.js`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.7.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue. || Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.

Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wrangler until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.\n\n || Sending specially crafted HTTP requests and inspector messages to Wrangler's dev server could result in any file on the user's computer being accessible over the local network. An attacker that could trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website could also read any file.\n || The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2.

Possible spoofing of IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in) outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used.\n\nThis poses a possible security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody that want to.\n\nVersions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this issue.\n || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik. || authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect. || authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context[\"pending_user\"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebars_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/OAuth2ProviderForm_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/HorizontalFormElement_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/docs_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/docs_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/goauthentik-authentik/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/goauthentik_authentik/sidebar_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"goauthentik/authentik","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-36456; CVE-2023-46249; CVE-2023-48228; CVE-2024-42490; CVE-2024-47070; CVE-2024-52289; CVE-2024-52307; CVE-2025-52553; CVE-2025-53942","commit_shas":"15026748d19d490eb2baf9a9566ead4f805f7dff; c07a48a3eccbd7b23026f72136d3392bbc6f795a; ea75741ec22ecef34bc7073f1163e17a8a2bf9fc; 261879022d25016d58867cf1f24e90b81ad618d0; cdb36b420a8520cad2377733e070a8756290758f; 3af77ab3821fe9c7df8055ba5eade3d1ecea03a6; 8fe02b2aafb54aae12fb135d65eceeebc4dfc8e9; b88e39411c12e3f9e04125a7887f12354f760a14; 6b9afed21f7c39f171a4a445654cfe415bba37d5; 7a2110e455a00a66eac860df2a37151952ea8fe2; 359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11; 19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c; dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf; 78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29; 85bb638243c8d7ea42ddd3b15b3f51a90d2b8c54; 5ea4580884f99369f0ccfe484c04cb03a66e65b8; 0e07414e9739b318cff9401a413a5fe849545325; 7100d3c6741853f1cfe3ea2073ba01823ab55caa; 65373ab21711d58147b5cb9276c5b5876baaa5eb; c3629d12bfe3d32d3dc8f85c0ee1f087a55dde8f; 7a4c6b9b50f8b837133a7a1fd2cb9b7f18a145cd; ce3f9e3763c1778bf3a16b98c95d10f4091436ab","publish_date":"2025-07-23","severity":"HIGH:10; UNKNOWN:10; CRITICAL:4","summary":"authentik is an open-source Identity Provider.

Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue. || matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1. || matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these \"shared\" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.

applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization. Please see the documentation for more. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. || NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization. || `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding. || NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware, developers can manually do a basic authentication.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/errors_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/assert_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/cookie_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/[...nextauth]_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/init_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/signin_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/types_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/nextauthjs_next-auth/email_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/nextauthjs-next-auth/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hd

Server provide file storage for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Starting in version 26.0.0 and prior to version 26.0.2, an attacker could supply a URL that redirects an unsuspecting victim from a legitimate domain to an attacker's site. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform. In Nextcloud Server prior to versions 26.0.9 and 27.1.4; as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 23.0.12.13, 24.0.12.9, 25.0.13.4, 26.0.9, and 27.1.4; when an attacker manages to get access to an active session of another user via another way, they could delete and modify workflows by sending calls directly to the API bypassing the password confirmation shown in the UI. Nextcloud Server versions 26.0.9 and 27.1.4 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 23.0.12.13, 24.0.12.9, 25.0.13.4, 26.0.9, and 27.1.4 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. || Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. A malicious user was able to send delete requests for old versions of files they only got shared with read permissions.

When a server is configured to only allow sharing with users that are in ones own groups, after a user was removed from a group, previously shared items were not unshared.

passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer. Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround. || Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue was patched in version 4.0.5.\n || A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).

HIGH:235; CRITICAL:54","summary":"In parser-server before version 4.1.0, you can fetch all the users objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

objects, by using regex in the NoSQL query. Using the NoSQL, you can use a regex on sessionToken and find valid accounts this way. || Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package \"parse-server\". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext. This is fixed in version 4.5.0 by stripping password after authentication to prevent cleartext password storage. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up. || Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions parse Server LiveQuery does not remove protected fields in classes, passing them to the client. The LiveQueryController now removes protected fields from the client response. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable t upgrade should use `Parse.Cloud.afterLiveQueryEvent` to manually remove protected fields. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.  || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\nThe fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1. || Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server crashes when uploading a file without extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 5.5.6 and 6.3.1.\n\n || parse-server is a Parse Server for Node.js / Express. This vulnerability allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.\n || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. A vulnerability in versions prior to 6.5.7 and 7.1.0 allows SQL injection when Parse Server is configured to use the PostgreSQL database. The algorithm to detect SQL injection has been improved in versions 6.5.7 and 7.1.0. No known workarounds are available. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2. || Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface.

requarks/wiki prior to 2.5.281. User can get root user permissions || Wiki.js is al wiki app built on Node.js. Client side template injection was discovered, that could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the content section of pages that would execute once a victim loads the page that contains the payload. This was possible through the injection of a invalid HTML tag with a template injection payload on the next line. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.303.\n || Wiki.js is an open source wiki app built on Node.js. A disabled user can still gain access to a wiki by abusing the password reset function. While setting up SMTP e-mail's on my server, I tested said e-mails by performing a password reset with my test user. To my shock, not only did it let me reset my password, but after resetting my password I can get into the wiki I was locked out of. The ramifications of this bug is a user can **bypass an account disabling by requesting their password be reset**.  All users of wiki.js version `2.5.303` who use any account restrictions and have disabled user are affected. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.304 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/group_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/group_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/renderer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/renderer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/requarks-wiki/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/users_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/requarks_wiki/users_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"salvoravida/react-adal","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Frontend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-7787","commit_shas":"716642464b0c891df64e414c45f1d1dad8f3fd4d","publish_date":"2020-12-09","severity":"HIGH:8","summary":"This affects all versions of package react-adal. It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic. The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (\"\") will always be in the list of the valid values. Therefore, if an empty session parameter is provided in the callback URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token contains an nonce value of \"\" (empty string), then adal.js will consider the JWT token as authentic.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/salvoravida-react-adal/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/salvoravida_react-adal/adal_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"snyk/kubernetes-monitor","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2023-1065","commit_shas":"93be7784ad4048a7d4eda4537cb3cd4e58453d75; 5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157","publish_date":"2023-02-28","severity":"MEDIUM:19","summary":"This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues.
