Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3 || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality).

Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`.

In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.

Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users using a version prior to 2.0.0.

Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3 || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality).

This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`.

This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/signal-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/signal-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/stream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/stream-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/lasso_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/lasso_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionResolve_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionResolve_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTest_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTest_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTuples_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTuples_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/scale-gradient_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/scale-gradient_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/scales_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/vega_vega/scales_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_11_vuln.js"

Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3 || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.\n || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/signal-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/signal-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/stream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/stream-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/lasso_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/lasso_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionResolve_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionResolve_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTest_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTest_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTuples_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionTuples_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/scale-gradient_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/scale-gradient_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/scales_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/vega_vega/scales_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_11_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_11_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/

Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3 || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.\n || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue.

The 'vega.mergeConfig' method within vega-util could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of the Object.prototype. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Vega in an npm package. In Vega before version 5.17.3 there is an XSS vulnerability in Vega expressions. Through a specially crafted Vega expression, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript on a victim's machine. This is fixed in version 5.17.3 || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.\n || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability. || Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/mergeConfig_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/mergeConfig_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/mergeConfig-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/signal-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/signal-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/stream-test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/stream-test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/lasso_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/lasso_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionResolve_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionResolve_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionTest_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionTest_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionTuples_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionTuples_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/selectionVisitor_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/scale-gradient_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/scale-gradient_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_10_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/scales_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/vega_vega/scales_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/vega-vega/sample_11_vuln.js"
