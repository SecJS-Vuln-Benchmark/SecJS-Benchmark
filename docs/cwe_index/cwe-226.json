In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0. || wire-webapp is the web version of Wire, an open-source messenger. A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in wire-webapp prior to version 2021-06-01-production.0. If a user is instructed to open an image in a new tab (right click -> open in new tab, or copy the URL and paste it in the URL bar), an the image payload is executed on the domain hosting the app (app.wire.com). In particular, if an image contains malicious code in addition to the actual picture, this code is executed on app.wire.com. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. The vulnerability was patched in version 2021-06-01-production.0. As a workaround, users should not try to open image URLs. || Wire webapp is a web client for the wire messaging protocol. In versions prior to 2022-01-27-production.0 expired ephemeral messages were not reliably removed from local chat history of Wire Webapp. In versions before 2022-01-27-production.0 ephemeral messages and assets might still be accessible through the local search functionality. Any attempt to view one of these message in the chat view will then trigger the deletion. This issue only affects locally stored messages. On premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to 2022-01-27-production.0, so that their users are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. || wire-webapp is the web application interface for the wire messaging service. Insufficient escaping in markdown “code highlighting” in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-03-30-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches * The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. * On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected. ### Workarounds * No workarounds known ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory feel free to email us at [vulnerability-report@wire.com](mailto:vulnerability-report@wire.com) ### Credits We thank [Posix](https://twitter.com/po6ix) for reporting this vulnerability || wire-webapp is the web application for the open-source messaging service Wire. A bug fix caused a regression causing an issue with function to delete local data. Instructing the client to delete its local database on user logout does not result in deletion. This is the case for both temporary clients (marking the device as a public computer on login) and regular clients instructing the deletion of all personal information and conversations upon logout. Access to the machine is required to access the data. If encryption-at-rest is used, cryptographic material can't be exported. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-14-production.0. In order to mitigate potential impact, the database must be manually deleted on devices where the option \"This is a public computer\" was used prior to log in or a log out with the request to delete local data with the affected versions has happened before.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/AppLock_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/AppLock_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/Config_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/Config_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/imageAsset_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/imageAsset_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/InputBarViewModel_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/InputBarViewModel_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/image-worker_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/image-worker_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_5_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_5_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/ConversationRepository_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/ConversationRepository_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_6_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_6_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/ConversationService_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/ConversationService_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_7_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_7_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/EventService_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/EventService_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_8_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_8_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/messageRenderer_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/messageRenderer_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_9_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/wireapp-wire-webapp/sample_9_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/wireapp_wire-webapp/package_fixed.js"}]}]
