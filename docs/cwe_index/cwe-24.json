To exploit this vulnerability, one must open a file in Typora. The XSS vulnerability is then triggered due to improper HTML sanitization. Given that the application is based on the Electron framework, the XSS leads to remote code execution in an unsandboxed environment. || Cure53 DOMPurify before 2.0.17 allows mutation XSS.
