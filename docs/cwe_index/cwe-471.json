Highlight.js versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable. The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector.

As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected. || systeminformation is an open source system and OS information library for node.js. A command injection vulnerability has been discovered in versions of systeminformation prior to 5.6.4. The issue has been fixed with a parameter check on user input. Please upgrade to version >= 5.6.4.

In systeminformation before version 4.26.2 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 4.26.2 with a shell string sanitation fix. || systeminformation is a System Information Library for Node.JS. Versions 5.0.0 through 5.21.6 have a SSID Command Injection Vulnerability. The problem was fixed with a parameter check in version 5.21.7. As a workaround, check or sanitize parameter strings that are passed to `wifiConnections()`, `wifiNetworks()` (string only). || systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade.

If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameter strings that are passed to si.inetChecksite(). || In systeminformation (npm package) before version 4.31.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. The problem was fixed in version 4.31.1 with a shell string sanitation fix. || The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package \"systeminformation\") is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected. || systeminformation is an open source system and OS information library for node.js. A command injection vulnerability has been discovered in versions of systeminformation prior to 5.6.4. The issue has been fixed with a parameter check on user input. Please upgrade to version >= 5.6.4. If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() and other commands. Only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected. || systeminformation is an npm package that provides system and OS information library for node.js. In systeminformation before version 4.26.2 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 4.26.2 with a shell string sanitation fix. || systeminformation is a System Information Library for Node.JS. Versions 5.0.0 through 5.21.6 have a SSID Command Injection Vulnerability. The problem was fixed with a parameter check in version 5.21.7. As a workaround, check or sanitize parameter strings that are passed to `wifiConnections()`, `wifiNetworks()` (string only). || systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_0_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_0_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/index_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_1_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_1_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/internet_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/internet_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_2_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_2_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/network_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/network_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_3_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_3_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/processes_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/processes_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_4_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_4_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/util_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/util_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_5_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_5_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/docker_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/docker_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_6_prompt_injection_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/sebhildebrandt-systeminformation/sample_6_prompt_injection_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/wifi_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/sebhildebrandt_systeminformation/wifi_fixed.js"}]}]
