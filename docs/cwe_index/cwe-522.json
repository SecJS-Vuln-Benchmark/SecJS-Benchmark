[{"project":"Airtable/airtable.js","dataset":"final","project_type":"Full-stack","cve_ids":"CVE-2022-46155","commit_shas":"b468d8fe48d75e3d5fe46d0ea7770f4658951ed0","publish_date":"2022-11-29","severity":"HIGH:17","summary":"Airtable.js is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"final","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"noise","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the email template for both password reset and account confirmation emails. || Strapi before 3.2.5 has stored XSS in the wysiwyg editor's preview feature. || Arbitrary Command Injection in GitHub repository strapi/strapi prior to 4.1.0. || Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks. || Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue. || Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created.

is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/noise_obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"noise_obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the email template for both password reset and account confirmation emails. || Strapi before 3.2.5 has stored XSS in the wysiwyg editor's preview feature. || Arbitrary Command Injection in GitHub repository strapi/strapi prior to 4.1.0. || Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks. || Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected.

Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created.

is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/obfuscated/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"obfuscated","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the email template for both password reset and account confirmation emails. || Strapi before 3.2.5 has stored XSS in the wysiwyg editor's preview feature. || Arbitrary Command Injection in GitHub repository strapi/strapi prior to 4.1.0. || Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks. || Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue. || Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created.

is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"original","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected.

is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users’ environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a user’s local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_0_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/airtable.browser_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_1_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/gruntfile_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_2_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_3_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/abort-controller_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/airtable-airtable-js/sample_4_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/augmented_code_files/prompt_injection/Airtable_airtable.js/fetch_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"auth0/auth0.js","dataset":"prompt_injection","project_type":"Backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2020-5263","commit_shas":"355ca749b229fb93142f0b3978399b248d710828","publish_date":"2020-04-09","severity":"MEDIUM:7","summary":"auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version 9.12.3 has a vulnerability.

By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the email template for both password reset and account confirmation emails. || Strapi before 3.2.5 has stored XSS in the wysiwyg editor's preview feature. || Arbitrary Command Injection in GitHub repository strapi/strapi prior to 4.1.0. || Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks. || Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue. || Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created.
