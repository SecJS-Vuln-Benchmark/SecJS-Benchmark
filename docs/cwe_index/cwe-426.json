This vulnerability occurs when the application is ran on Windows OS. || The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.","files":[{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_0_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_0_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/package_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/package_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_1_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_1_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/build-artifacts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/build-artifacts_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_2_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_2_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/env.test_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/env.test_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_3_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_3_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/dlx_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/dlx_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_4_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_4_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/runRecursive_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/runRecursive_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_5_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_5_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/copy-artifacts_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/copy-artifacts_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_6_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_6_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/pickPackage_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/pickPackage_fixed.js"},{"vulnerable_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_7_final_vuln.js","fixed_path":"docs/cwe_samples/pnpm-pnpm/sample_7_final_fixed.js","original_vulnerable":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/index_vulnerable.js","original_fixed":"/data_hdd/lx20/fqy_workspace/js_vuln_benchmark/dataset/databackup/code_files/pnpm_pnpm/index_fixed.js"}]},{"project":"yarnpkg/yarn","dataset":"final","project_type":"backend","cve_ids":"CVE-2019-10773; CVE-2020-8131; CVE-2019-15608; CVE-2021-4435; CVE-2025-8262","commit_shas":"039bafd74b7b1a88a53a54f8fa6fa872615e90e7; fc76f230e5d9a8bd37cbbdda1b38e9e19a1db950; 0474b8c66a8ea298f5e4dedc67b2de464297ad1c; 67fcce88935e45092ffa2674c08053f1ef5268a1; af396d504054051b5ccf529369746f600e8ca4fa","publish_date":"2025-07-28","severity":"HIGH:7; MEDIUM:2","summary":"In Yarn before 1.21.1, the package install functionality can be abused to generate arbitrary symlinks on the host filesystem by using specially crafted \"bin\" keys.

This vulnerability occurs when the application is ran on Windows OS. || The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue.

Existing files could be overwritten depending on the current user permission set. || Arbitrary filesystem write vulnerability in Yarn before 1.22.0 allows attackers to write to any path on the filesystem and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by forcing the user to install a malicious package. || The package integrity validation in yarn < 1.19.0 contains a TOCTOU vulnerability where the hash is computed before writing a package to cache. It's not computed again when reading from the cache. This may lead to a cache pollution attack. || An untrusted search path vulnerability was found in Yarn. When a victim runs certain Yarn commands in a directory with attacker-controlled content, malicious commands could be executed in unexpected ways. || A vulnerability was found in yarnpkg Yarn up to 1.22.22.
